#the folder contains templates for bash code and slides for the conda environment tutorial
Hello all,

Thank you for expressing interest!

The workshop will happen next Thursday (July 10th) from 2pm to probably around 4:30pm, with a tea break around 3pm, at the Bioinformatics Room.

For the workshop, you will need access to the Crop Diversity Server, as we'll focus on Environment and Project Design, with a bit of code management.

If you are using Windows/Linus system, I highly recommend downloading the free version of Mobaxterm  (https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/download-home-edition.html), which provides very handy file upload/download channels and default text editor for codes. It is also very intuitive when you need to connect to Crop Diversity with the Private Key.

There are five desktops where you can login (Windows system) in the Bioinformatics Room, but you might prefer to bring your own laptop for accessing Crop Diversity Server, as anything you downloaded onto your personal laptop at work (including Mobaxterm in my case) will probably not be found on the local drive of that RBGE desktop.

I will post all the Workshop material on my Github soon: https://github.com/Zedthedrifter/Workshops-and-Guides/tree/main/Conda%20Env%20Workshop
It is in my regular repository where I update guides for manipulating RBGE resources, esp. DataHeap. The Conda Env Workshop folder includes some coding templates and the slides for the workshop. I will try to put enough text explanation on the slides, so for whoever cannot join us this time but is still interested, you may have a look at the slides. I am planning on offering another round after September. 

And thanks again for those already expressed interest! I am looking forward to see you next Thursday.

Best,
Zed
